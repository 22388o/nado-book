## RGB

![Bitcoin, Explained ep. 33](qr/33.png)

The trio discusses RGB tokens, a Layer Two protocol for Bitcoin to support alternative currency and token schemes (like the currently popular non-fungible tokens, or NFTs).

Aaron, Sjors and Ruben explain that the Bitcoin blockchain has been (ab)used by users to host data since the projectâ€™s early days. This was initially done through otherwise-useless transaction outputs, which meant that all Bitcoin users had to store this data locally. A feature called OP_RETURN later limited this burden.They also explain that people have been using the Bitcoin blockchain to host alternative currency and token schemes for a long time.
