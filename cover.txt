Bitcoin is old and boring, or so they say... Nothing could be further from the truth. This book will guide you through the latest developments in Bitcoin, as seen through the eyes of one of its many developers.

You'll learn about the latest softfork known as Taproot, the challenges of keeping open source source software free of money stealing bugs and malware, new ways to protect nodes against evildoers on the internet, how to deal with the ever growing blockchain, and more!

Each chapter links to a corresponding episode of the Bitcoin, Explained podcast, as well as other places where you can learn more.
