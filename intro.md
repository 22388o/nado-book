Each chapter contains a QR code which takes you to the corresponding podcast episode and its shownotes. The episode number is shown below the QR. You can also find the episode in your favorite podcasting application by searching for "Bitcoin Explained". Or play them in your browser from here^[<https://nadobtc.libsyn.com>].

TODO: explain what Bitcoin Core is (often referred to). Appendix @sec:crime_on_testnet includes screenshots and shows a typical workflow of sending and receiving Bitcoin.

A quick note on reader privacy: the big QR codes point directly to their target website and they do not use referral links. Nobody can track that you came from this book. The tiny QR codes however go through bit.ly. I created the short URL's without an account, so I can't track you, but bit.ly might be able to, with some effort.
