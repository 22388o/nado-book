# More episodes {epub:type=appendix}

Not all episodes of Bitcoin, Explained made it into this book. Here's some other episodes you could listen to:

### Bitcoin Beach

![Ep. 42 {l0pt}](qr/42.png)

Co-host Aaron van Wirdum speaks with Bitcoin Beach Wallet developer Nicolas Burtey in El Zonte, El Salvador — which has been dubbed Bitcoin Beach — to discuss the Bitcoin Beach Wallet, a Bitcoin and Lightning wallet specifically designed for use in the small Central American coastal town frequented by surfers and, now, bitcoiners.

They discuss the pros and cons of custodial and non-custodial Lightning wallets, and Nicolas explains why he opted to make the Bitcoin Beach Wallet a shared-custodial wallet, and what that means exactly.

They go one to discuss some of the design decisions and tradeoffs that the Bitcoin Beach Wallet has made, which include ledger-based payments between Bitcoin Beach Wallet users as well as the webpage-based zero invoice payments to facilitate payments from other Lightning wallets. while Nicolas speculates about a potential cross-wallet user account system to further improve the Lightning user experience over time.

Aaron and Nicolas also discuss some of the subtle incompatibilities between different Lightning wallets that use different techniques for routing payments, privacy considerations versus user experience in a community like El Zonte’s, and more.

### Chivo

In this episode we discuss discuss the Chivo application, the Bitcoin wallet, and payment terminal provided by the government of El Salvador. The Chivo app is closed source software. Instead of analyzing the source code and design of the application, we had to rely on Aaron’s personal experience with the wallet and payment terminal or what he remembers of that personal experience. The episode opens with some general information about the Chivo Wallet, like why it was developed and who developed it (insofar anything is known about that). We discuss Aaron’s experiences with the wallet and speculate what that means for the design. After that, we discuss the design of the payment terminal that’s included in the application, and also briefly touch on the Chivo ATMs that have been deployed across the country. Finally, we discuss the difference in philosophy between the design of the Chivo application and Bitcoin’s free and open-source software culture.

### RGB

We are joined by Ruben Somsen to discuss RGB tokens, a Layer Two protocol for Bitcoin to support alternative currency and token schemes (like the currently popular non-fungible tokens, or NFTs).

We explain that the Bitcoin blockchain has been (ab)used by users to host data since the project’s early days. This was initially done through otherwise-useless transaction outputs, which meant that all Bitcoin users had to store this data locally. A feature called `OP_RETURN` later limited this burden.They also explain that people have been using the Bitcoin blockchain to host alternative currency and token schemes for a long time.

A few years ago I also gave a presentation about RGB as well as earlier attemps at using the Bitcoin blockchain to store non-money things: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgeqT6ruBWU>
