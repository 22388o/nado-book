\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Thanks goes out of to my co-host Aaron van Wirdum for helping me explain the technical stuff in my head. Similarly my editor Natalye Childress helped me clarify things even more, by transforming the podcast episodes to chapters and asking lots of clarifying questions.

Thanks to Bitcoin Magazine for editing, publishing, promoting and later even rebranding the podcast.

Michael Folkson wrote several of the transcripts for the Taproot activation episodes.

The episode show notes were written by Aaron. The form the basis of appendix A which describe episodes not covered in the book.

Finally thanks to all the Bitcoin Core developers and other volunteers who work to make Bitcoin a success, and my life interesting.
